The Flask backend provides RESTful API endpoints for user authentication and manages user data with a SQLite database:

- `/signup` (POST): Register a new user with email and password (passwords are hashed securely).
- `/login` (POST): Authenticate existing users.
- Utilizes `Flask-Bcrypt` for password hashing.
- Uses `Flask-CORS` to enable cross-origin requests from the frontend.
- Manages sessions for user login persistence.
- Database models defined using SQLAlchemy ORM.
